# Spookreads
Spookreads is an iOS/iPadOS

# Proxy down?
My server likes to occaisionally shut itself down for no real reason, I blame Proxmox.
If the API requests fail for some reason, you are actually connected to the internet, and you have tried all of the regular troubleshooting steps (including turning it off and on again), then ping me on Slack or email me at `evan@consciousb.one` and I'll get it working again ASAP!
